# diffraction-demos
A few diffraction demos from the lesson on 2 March

# Diffraction demo 1D

This demo uses the Fast Fourier transform to compute the diffraction integrals for numerous apertures. The first cell contains all the functions required to do this and the cells afterwards contain demoes using this. (Although it includes a function for a straight edge, this doesn't work, which makes sense when you think about how the program works)

# Diffraction demo 2D

This demo also uses the Fast Fourier transform to compute the diffraction integrals for numerous apertures. 

# How to

The code can be run online at the following page: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/ti250/diffraction-demos). You should see a file explorer, and you can click on the demos to look at them, run them and even edit them, although any changes are not saved.

If you want to experiment more with coding, the instructions [here](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook#gs.pgiYxgE) should work, although I would ignore the bit on setting up docker containers, after which you can download the files from this repository and run them yourself following the instructions. To learn some more programming, [this course](https://github.com/PyCav/Course/tree/master/IA/Lessons) may be a decent place to start, but I would obviously say that because I was part of the team that made it.
