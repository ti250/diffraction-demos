A few diffraction demos from the lesson on 2 March

# Diffraction demo 1D

This demo uses the Fast Fourier transform to compute the diffraction integrals for numerous apertures. The first cell contains all the functions required to do this and the cells afterwards contain demoes using this. (Although it includes a function for a straight edge, this doesn't work, which makes sense when you think about how the program works)

# Diffraction demo 2D

This demo also uses the Fast Fourier transform to compute the diffraction integrals for numerous apertures.
